# Windows-Batch-Library

The **Window Batch Library** is a collection of pre-written macros, functions, and constants
that can be used to simplify and speed up the process of creating command-line interfaces (CLIs) 
and other types of text-based user interfaces (TUIs).

*This library includes a wide range of functions and macros, including standard console manipulations, 
mathematical calculations, color and  text formatting, and mouse input.*

    +Basic mathematical operations: For performing basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These scripts can be particularly useful for automating calculations that need to be performed repeatedly.

    +Advanced mathematical functions: For performing advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponential functions. These scripts can be particularly useful for scientific research and data analysis.

    +Graphics generation: For generating 2D graphics. These scripts can be particularly useful for computer-aided design and computer graphics applications.
    
    +Data visualization: For visualizing data using graphs, charts, and other visual representations. These scripts can be particularly useful for scientific research and data analysis.

Overall, the **Window Batch Library** is a powerful tool for anyone looking to create 
command-line interfaces or other types of text-based user interfaces using Windows Batch 
scripting. By providing a range of pre-written functions and macros, the library can help 
streamline the development process and make it easier to create complex and powerful 
applications using the command line.
